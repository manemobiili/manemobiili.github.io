# Biography thing

In the year of malbolge i was born. Our family had a computer ever since i can remember. That was a big influence that lead me to this programmer path that i am after today.
I think a lot of programmer's share a similiar childhood.

This is 99% about nostalgia and yapping about video games **way too much**. So it may not be your cup of tea.

## 1998-2000

Can't recall. I was in diapers. This was around time the first Matrix movie came out, Half-Life came out, and many game developers started embracing 3D enviroments.
I think my favorite Point n' click adventure is Grim Fandango, which came out in 1998 as well. NGL pretty good year.

## 2000's

1.  Kindergarden

    My first videogame being Midtown Maddness 2, i enjoyed spending time with fellow kids collecting CD-ROMs out of cereal boxes.
    Then we got a retail video game for pc: NHL 2003 . I must have played it every day because i was addicted to anything hockey.
    *A small detail with the NHL-games^ they were released in the previous year, so NHL 2003 came out late 2002.*

2.  Schüt games

    I got really into consoles too, after playing playstation 2 in my neighbor kids place i spent my 7th birthday money on PS2 slim and Lego star wars. No memory card or extra controllers: just the essentials.
    After visiting friends i got introduced to GTA Vice City which is a bit much for a 7y/o. Then Sly Cooper francise which is one of my favorites. I played them in 3, 1, 2 order but it didn't matter.
    I really fond these memories.
    Innocent platforming, racing and sporting games turned into action games around mid 2000, after playing James Bond Night Fire, Star Wars Battlefront II&#x2026; etc.
    
    Don't worry, we spent time outside too.

3.  Internet and lots of legos!

    This is around time we got internet in the household, and i got really into Counter-Strike. First playing bots and sometime later online.
    Every kid i knew had played it. Everybody got it illegaly from a site called kivitie, which hasn't been online for a long time.
    Yeah, we were criminal kids. I think it's been long enough to come clean about that.
    
    Habbo Hotel, MSN Messenger and YouTube became big time sinks. I watched a lot of Lego Projects, Machinima *(anybody remember Leet World?)*, RWJ, Smosh&#x2026;
    YouTube poop's and it's finnish relative Sinätuubapaska were born.
    I wasn't making my own flash games or anything, but i spent a good amount of time in Windows movie maker, then Sony Vegas 7 and Sony Vegas Pro 8.
    I was so inspired by Counter-Strike and James Bond that i made a couple of stop motion movies from legos around it.

4.  Ice skating

    I learned to skate on ice at a young age. Later my mother signed me into a hockey team when i was 7, and that has always been my favorite sport.
    After 2 years we were out of goaltenders so i took a try and it became my position for 5 years,
    then i invested that time in learning guitar, which lasted another 5 years before going back to hockey.
    I was inspired by Tony Hawk games and Jet Set Radio Future to skate on asphalt too. While it was fun, my interest didn't last to get good.
    My favorite sport in the summer was probably baseball. Our small town had a way better baseball team than hockey team, that's for sure!

5.  Linux experience #1

    I can recall being in 3rd or 4th grade, and we had an hour a week of IT classes. Each school computer had windows dual booting with Ubuntu 8.04 i belive.
    Of course as little children we couldn't make much of it, but i really liked the gnome 2 interface and the orange colour scheme.

6.  Playstation 2 & Wii

    I was pretty certain i was already done with consoles, since Playstation 2 was so good and Playstation 3 costed like 500€. But i fell for wii after trying wii sports bowling in my friends place.
    As anybody else, i thought motion controls were the next big thing. I played a lot of Wii sports, Guitar Hero III and Super Smash Bros Brawl on that thing.
    Regarding which is the GOAT: Playstation 2 came out 2000 and wii came out 2006, so Playstation 2 was the most influential console to ever exist.
    Mine are still in a working condition. So i can listen to kid version of me singing singstar nonsense. Off of memory cards using homebrew magick.

7.  My First "gaming" PC

    In 2009 i got my first "gaming" computer for 300€:
    
    -   Athlon X2 250, Stock cooler
    -   Single stick of DDR3 2Gb RAM
    -   HD 4570 or something along those lines *(first component to die)*
    -   1TB Western Digital Green HDD
    -   ASRock M3A785GM-LE *(ugliest motherboard ASRock has ever been made)*
    
    I loved it!
    
    Our family shared 2 computer's total - my sister's laptop and my desktop pc.
    We may have had one extra in the closet but even back then it was too old. I still have it around intact. Looking back at it it should run fine if it had a decent graphics card.
    There were no opengl support whatsoever. You can still get a lot of utility out of them. But it doesn't make much sense because they're so power hungry.
    
    I got my first steam account with Counter-Strike: Source, and i enjoyed GMOD 9 too. Around a year later i got a used account with Left 4 Dead 2 and Team Fortress 2 for 10€.
    CSS is still my most played game between 2000-3000 hours, most of it was spent in "sauna" servers. As of 2023 there's one or two servers still going.
    It's a fun time to play with friends, and talk to strangers in voice comms.


<a id="orga59c67a"></a>

## 2010's

1.  Servers

    In 2010 When i was a 12 y/o kid playing around in Counter Strike, i had my first exposure to code in the form of AMX Mod X scripts.
    
    Amx Mod X <https://www.amxmodx.org/> is for goldsrc games.
    Sourcemod <https://www.sourcemod.net/> is for source games.
    
    I didn't understand anything, but it was cool being able to open files and see what's there.
    Game hosting also thought me basic networking like gateways and ports. It's a valuable skill in itself.
    I can recall being intrigued about ruby back then, but that didn't lead anywhere. (until 2022)
    There is a high propability of me making super basic webpages in that era. ***cough*** isn't that where a lot of people get their start?

2.  Linux experience #2

    I was vagely interested in hacking culture as well. Wow such elite h4x0r!
    *DEFCON 18: Pwned By The Owner: What Happens When You Steal a Hackers Computer* was one of the first presentations i remember watching. It's still one of the most entertaining talks i've ever seen.
    link: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAI8S2houW4> then i tried out Backtrack 4 livedvd (nowadays it's called Kali). I was a kid back then so i had no idea how to even navigate the command line.

3.  Tech world evolves

    Early 2010's was pretty wild time. Smartphones and social media grew *;\_; sadly killing Flipnote Hatena for DSi*, lets-plays and livestreaming took off,
    many companies turned their software into service models, global surveillance disclosures&#x2026; then Finland got gold at IIHF 2011 \\(:D)/!

4.  360 NoscopeZ

    I had a small perioid of time with friends playing Call of Duty, Halo and other XBOX 360 titles. Quickscoping and Zombies became a big part of my day.
    It was a routine to chat with strangers on the good ol' xbox 360 lobbies.

5.  Religion

    There was this one youth centre in a middle of dead town i will remember fondly.
    I've never felt such a cozy, nice and warm bond between people before that. We've had cried and laughed together. It was so pleasant.
    But frankly speaking i've never felt that connection to god. Or any religion really. I just loved the atmosphere of people there.
    And it was the most fun time i think i've ever had. Like a tribe.
    Partying with drugs and alcohol doesn't come close in my personal opinion. But then we all got older and moved to different places. Good luck to you all where ever you are!

6.  Theatre 2014-2016

    One of my friends asked me to participate in  summer theatre. I didn't have more than one or two lines so i went with it.
    It can get annoying spending so much time practising very little. I had fun and a small relationship while there.
    I had an amazing 18th birthday with sauna and tequila.

7.  School's out

    Fast forward to 2014, i got out of comprehensive school, i studied *basically Graphic Design* in vocational school.
    I was ok with it not being my livelyhood, it's a skill i wanted to have regardless of my occupation in later life. But my photoshop skills didn't improve much at there.
    
    I never really learned to draw art, but i got to spend time thinking about typography stuff. I was more leanient toward digital design and didn't care about print in the slightest.
    Unfortunately all we could do was physical print stuff like calendars, roll-ups, signs, shirts, stickers, what have you. They weren't considering the web at all.
    
    It was pretty hard place to get by, where no-one is really motivated to beging with. But i'd say my first year in higher up schools were the most fun one, due to student community at the time.

8.  Linux experience #3 & BSD experience #1

    On the bright side i got to go at parties, got old computer's from people without paying a cent. I did trade in my xbox 360 for old desktop. Then made many small
    installation projects like Tiny Linux laptop and a Pfsense router after having QoS issues with the networking.
    Sure i had installed weird systems by now, but i still had no idea how to operate linux properly yet.

9.  Linux experience #4

    Steam got announced to linux in Feb 2013. around that time my stepbrothers place had their home computer turned into linux mint machine. Either one of us didn't know how to operate the damn thing.
    It felt wrong that every application was installed via. "appstore" *(turns out, you compile it)* And i never liked to look of Linux Mint. Honestly it's fine but i don't like glassy look of Windows 7 either.
    I may be in the minority here. Stepbro got put off linux for life, but i was becoming more interested in it. Maybye it's some sort of weird mentality thing.

10. Lession: GPUs are a terrible invesment

    I ordered a brand new GTX 770 without any other components. I wanted to gradually upgrade but i wasn't prepared at all. It needed 2 8-pin connectors.
    So i had it gathering dust for many many years.

11. Quake Live

    2014 was my first introduction to arenafps. I've previously played online matches and casually speedran Half-Life, but this was something different.
    My 2009 gaming computer barely managed to play Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, and i was ready to move on from CS. So i started looking at other games.
    Quake Live! In 2014 I played probably a hundred hours of duel alone. And i got a big adrenaline rush from it! Quake pros are hardcore, i recommend everybody to try it or at least watch it.
    Deathmatch is very liberating movement wise when compaired to most shooters.
    They were super popular late 90's but Halo, Counter-Strike and CoD took their place with more accessible gameplay.
    After all, getting rekt in Quake isn't fun. You have to choose when to approach, fall back, time items, aim and dodge affectively.
    And if you fuck up, you'll probably pay it with multiple lives. You can out-stack the opponent which made it more chess-like.
    But don't be discouraged, there are a lot of players that get into it after spending a year playing, but it takes <span class="underline">a lot</span> of dedication.
    And nowadays i think that team based gamemodes are more fun than duel anyway. It's way nicer if you're new too.
    
    Quake ran beautifully, and quake games let you modify anything you want in the game. Most notable settings being r<sub>picmip</sub>.
    ID didn't constrain players from tweaking everything they wanted which is awesome! It might be because of quake that i started to tweak everything in my disposal, like my beloved wii.

12. Super Smash Bros: Melee

    2015 was time i started playing Super Smash Brother's Melee with my stepbro. We had a scratched the disk so we were looking at alternative ways to play that melee.
    Softmodding wii is one of the easiest mods there is, as long as red letterbomb exploit is around.
    My stepbro plays Roy and he whooped my ass in melee, so i started studying the game and ended up playing peach. It's my favorite character followed by Ice Climbers, Dr. Mario, Yoshi, Luigi, DK.

13. Lession: Seriously, don't use windows xp for production

    In this point i got some extra room and a couple of computer parts to make new computer builds, i'm too cheap to pay for expensive stuff, i'd much rather try my best optimizing what i have.
    I started to experiment more than usual, i love windows xp a lot because that's what i grew up with. And finding "zune" dark theme for xp made it feel refreshing.
    So i used XP for a bit doing magazines with Adobe Indesign. Needless to say that under big time pressure system crashed and blue screened a lot.

14. Rooted smartphone attempt #1

    I had a HTC One M8 and it turned out very difficult to execute. I unlocked the bootloader but didn't manage to install custom rom there.
    
    My 2009 gaming computer started acting up: i jerryrigged an 6-pin adapter for beefier gpu without soldering iron, then on board ethernet plug stopped working.
    I installed external networking card and it worked fine for a couple of years to come. With my aging hardware i started looking at linux more.

15. Linux experience #5 & BSD experience #2

    I loved the linux content Teksyndicate put out around 2014-2015, so i thought it was time to try out linux for realsies.
    My first day to day linux was Linux Lite 2.X. Steam was supported on ubuntu but i wanted something much faster. So i found any ubuntu based distro on <https://distrowatch.com>.
    
    Then Debian 8 got released. I remember it was Mr. Gabe Newell's favorite distro so can't go wrong with that.
    I was pretty comfortable with the XFCE desktop, but you bet i had to try them all.
    
    In 2015 i saw this video <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=875NbdL39A0> and i tried out i3 wm and it was life changing. Eric S. Raymond is a legend.
    After that i never went back to dragging windows with mouse, unless it was a mac/windows system.
    Soon enough i started installing Arch using this video: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wqh9AQt3nho>
    
    I was playing sysadmin at the time so i got invested in bunch of distrobutions; Alpine, Fedora, FreeBSD, Gentoo & Slackware. I tried them all and distrohopping became a real problem.

16. Warsow

    So there's no more Quake Live for linux. I stumbled across Warsow <https://warsow.net/>. I enjoyed the cell-shaded style and gameplay of warsow so much that it took over quake for me.
    I spent countless hours playing duels against friends and strangers. You can go lightspeed if you know what you're doing and that made it even more interesting.
    I slowly started playing team based games like bomb which is the counter-strike format but more fun! I started hanging out in IRC more often, with discord taking it's place afterwards.

17. Programming inspiration

    My inspiration to learn lua was that it's regarded as an easy language, and Grim Fandango used it heavily.
    I was doing more and more tweaking with my computers, and steam worked fine for my gaming needs. I got incredibly unmotivated at working with print so i started pondering alternatives.
    Then i watched a lot of Eli the Computer guy at the time *(Yes, i am a YouTube addict)* It was a big influense to try programming professionally. I asked myself:
    *"So programmers type all day and get paid? Sounds good to me!"*
    I think my first programs were written in lua around 2015 when i was 17. Just your typical hello world and throw the dice game kind of stuff.

18. Darker days

    I was in a big rut for 2015 and 2016, because lack of progress in studies stressed me out. You know, the feeling of going nowhere?
    I enjoyed playing a lot of warsow, going for a swim every now and then and cook stuff. I wasn't to big on drinking after turning 18, i think i bought my first beer at 19.
    
    Infinite Waters wisdom helped me around a lot during that period. Saying things like: *"Happiness is an inside job!"*,
    *"Universe reveals it's secret's to those who dare follow their heart."* and *"The best relationship you can have is with yourself."* helped me out. I started to belive in life.
    I started writing notes, eating more plants and i installed OpenBSD for first time which was a refreshing experience after dealing with many many Linux problems in the past.

19. BSD experience #3: OpenBSD

    I hardly logged in steam after 2016. I was so intrigued by this OpenBSD. They're really good at saying **no**. Either you do a thing well or you don't do it at all!
    I watched Michael W. Lucas talks and was sold on it. I got myself an used kindle which was full of reading material. Most of it were technical literature. No fiction at all really.
    Rust was starting to pop off so i was invested in that language. I thought it was going to change everything before we know it, but i was severely underestimating how hard the language really is.
    So i tried out early version of redox os too which is pretty cool project. But i was over optimistic of my skills as a real programmer, i didn't do small exercises like you're supposed to.
    I wanted to make big things that didn't succeed. So i thought that if i can learn C first, maybe then i can come back to Rust. *Good luck on that, kiddo!*
    
    Around this time i made an account on github and made a small page on github pages. I was making more print stuff that i wanted to share. I got back on grind in Autumn of 2017.
    In november i got over 20 laptops from a seller in <https://tori.fi> for 50€. And half of them worked really well after finding power adapters for them.
    Most of them ran OpenBSD, because it's a good choise, especially for a old system. I learned a lot, and tried out every window manager that i could.
    I really liked ratpoison way of manual tiling, with xmonad coming second.

20. No to smartphones

    I had a brief perioid where my smartphone was kaput, not booting into anything just hanging in the recovery selection. Then i thought:
    *"I spend my time on computer in school, then spend my time in home on computer too. I don't need this smartphone holding me back!"*
    
    So i went without any form of cellphone for 3 months. I still had an mp3 player and digital camera to take on beach.
    It felt liberating not carrying anything valuable while out. Even if i lived in the middle of nowhere. If you value privacy then it's a good call to make.
    However it didn't last forever, i got a dumb phone for a year until i got a post package with this certain PDA.

21. Lesson: Be careful who you back on Kickstarter and Indiegogo

    I was intrigued by Gemini PDA. It's was one of those mobile linux efforts, that's not android. At the time it felt like i wouldn't need any linux pc if i had this thing.
    Software support was passable with android 8, jolla, debian and kali choises being available. But retrospectively touchscreens are cheaper, and even easier to use than a tiny hardware keyboard is.
    It was well designed but the manufacturing did a slocuhy job. I had it last for 2 years max before the plastic hinges broke apart. I got the Ethernet and HDMI adapters too but they were cheap as well.
    Looks like others have followed suite. After the product was out it died out in a year basically.

22. Raspberry Pi 3b

    I got invested in arm linux space, so i got myself a raspberry pi 3. It's a lot of fun and my favorite thing about it is the lack of fans. No noise coming out of this low power board.
    I didn't use my laptops that much after obtaining the pi, even if it was an order of magnitude slower. I started learning the terminal troughout with that thing.

23. Youre-in-the-army-now.mp3

    I finally got out of school just by the slim margin, and it was time to complete my army service. I had an awful start because i stepped on the wrong      bus.
    i was uncertain in the moment and stepped on one that left 10 minutes before the other bus. It all turned out ok though, i got to start there despite fucking up bad.
    I made a lot of mistakes and never felt good enough. It changed around when we got to change position and i was fixing aggregates. I could go on about that experience but my lips are sealed.

24. After army

    Army felt like the longest 6 months of my life. But i was ready for the next step; learning C. I moved in with parent who moved into lapland now, and started studying.

25. Oneplus 5T

    I got my sister's old phone, installed lineage os on it and it turned around my view on these gizmos. They're my favorite way of computing now!
    I was amazed by the speed difference of the pi and modern smartphone. I became an arm fanboy. Lineage OS is decent but someone should put native app development form the smartphone to the map already!

26. Small media gig

    I was doing part time work on some media education workshop company, i got to play with an old 3D printer which was the best part.
    But printing things really sucked the life out of me. And i didn't get along with some people there. I asked my stepfather for a building job and they complied.

27. Building house logs

    So i ended up working in house building company for a couple of years. It's my favorite job i've had despite having constant argument's with an unnamed employee. *(it's another common theme)*
    In the midst of Corona i had a ball watching twitch, building stuff and of course swimming. I was drinking quite a lot back then, but i enjoyed what i was doing. Maybe this is my tru calling.


<a id="org2fd6d36"></a>

## 2020's

1.  Crypto

    As many of you know: Bitcoin was popping off early 2020's. So i started an DCA plan. After three years my portfolio turned out -40% because i was naive. No-one was safe from the 2022 crash.
    I learned a lot about financing even if i lost. I'm still HODLing.

2.  First office job

    I didn't want to leave my building job, but i had a lot of arguments with this employee and i would get better pay from this office gig so i took it.
    2022 was a hard year for construction businesses, and that place went down with it.
    
    Being an helpdesk clerk wasn't so bad at the start, but after my grandmother passed away i couldn't cope with some employees in the new company.
    I didn't meet up to expectations no more, and i was laid off.
    
    Maybe i am terrible.
    
    I learned that i'm pretty bad at verbal communication, but i enjoyed spending time making *(terrible)* wordpress sites.
    Seriously, making a wordpress site is so easy after 5.9 that anyone who can manage a full site editing theme can get something done.
    But the long-term maintainability with third party plugins is a death sentence.
    
    I got really depressed after the layoff, and i genuinely thought that i was good for nothing. I started to take my software career more seriously.

3.  So i started my company

    I was into doing wordpress just for a quick buck, but more i thought about the web business, more i thought that the demand isn't really there. And the crazy ecosystem isn't good quality.
    There's so many solutions out in the wild and full stack developers that i would be better off doing something else. And not paying for dedicated servers for the time being.
    People don't want more services after the crash. They'll much rather spend it on more important things. I cant host a webpage for 5€ a month for a hundred people.
